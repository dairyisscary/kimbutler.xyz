## ["Cultures on Culture: Biofilm, Conservation, and the Interface of Art and Environment"][getty_cultures]

While a 2019-20 "Art and Ecology" postdoctoral fellow at the Getty Research Institute, I wrote a brief description of my
project in _The Getty Magazine_.

## ["Cigarettes, Saliva, Art: Laboratory Expertise in Florence, Italy"][cigarettes_florence]

In Florence, I followed artisanal and scientific restoration practices. This article focuses on seemingly trivial
material traces -- the monk's cigarette and the chemist's saliva -- as embodiments of these experts' confidence and
discernment with precious historical and aesthetic artifacts. I argue that both the artisan and the scientist perform
expertise by relying on sensory, craft-based familiarity with materials. Published in the _Journal of Modern Craft_.

## <a href={Microbes}>"Putting Microbes to Work: Using Biotechnology to Restore Architecture & Art in Italy"</a>

How are artworks and cultural heritage made into restoration "workspaces" for microbes? Here, I think through the
implications of the multispecies work that brings microbiologists and bacteria together to clean and consolidate
artifacts ranging from ancient clay terraces in Sicily to a modern stone statue in the Monumental Cemetery of Milan.

## ["All the World Is Here," Exhibition Review][all_world]

My colleague, Alison Laurence, and I reviewed the exhibition, _All the World Is Here: Harvard's Peabody Museum and the
Invention of American Anthropology_, at Harvard University's Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology. Published in the
_History of Anthropology Newsletter_.
