I am an anthropologist of art and science, with a focus on how authenticity, expertise, duration, and materiality come
to matter through laboratory practice. My current book project examines how scientists develop technologies for the
restoration of art and cultural heritage. I received my PhD in [History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology, and
Society (HASTS) at MIT][hasts] in 2019.

In 2019-20, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Scholars Program at the [Getty Research Institute][getty_scholars] in Los
Angeles. In 2020-21, I was an ACLS Emerging Voices Postdoctoral Fellow at Vanderbilt University. While at Vanderbilt, I
was also co-PI on a Mellon-funded, pedagogical project called "[Nested Knowledge: Disentangling History, Truth, and Race
in STEM Experiences][nested_knowledge]," described in [a short video here][nested_video].

Since 2021, I have been a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of History and Art History at Utrecht University,
where I am working in the ERC-funded project, [DURARE: Dynamics of the Durable: A History of Making Things Last in the
Visual and Decorative Arts][durare].
