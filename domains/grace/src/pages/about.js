      <p>
        I am an anthropologist of art and science, with a focus on how authenticity, expertise, and
        materiality come to matter through laboratory practice. My current book project examines how
        scientists develop technologies for the restoration of art and cultural heritage. I received
        my PhD in History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology, and Society (HASTS) at MIT in
        2019.
